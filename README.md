# Project Overview

The puporse of the project was to take a look at NYC bike sharing program to help visualize the data and present to possible investors to create a similar program in Des Moines.We specifically looked at bike trip analysis as that was requested by one of the key stakeholders.

We used provided data to demonstrate the following:
- How long bikes are checked out for all riders.
- How many trips are taken by the hour during the weekdays and all days of the week, for all riders and genders.
- What days a user (we broke this down by gender and subscriber/short term user) is more likely to check out a bike.

# Results

# Bike Transtactions by Trip Duration

This graph shows the trip duration of all users. The 0-59 minute trip duration is the most popular time for all transactions. With most being under 20 minutes.

The 5-10 minute duration is the most popular with all genders. Men having the highest number of usage in the 0-60 minute range, followed by women, and then unknown.

This helps visualize the usage during the week. The darker colors indicating higher usage. During the week Monday-Friday the usage increased from 5am-9am and 5pm-7pm. With highest usage in the morning around 8am and highest in the evening from 5p-6p. On the weekends the usage appears pretty consistent and no high peaks but highest usage around 11a-12pm on Saturday.

The usuage is very similar from men to women. The actual usage may be higher with men, but the times of increased usage is very similar. With the unknown genders, increased usage is on the weekends.
